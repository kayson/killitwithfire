= Visual C++ Express wxWidgets library =

In order to make the svn repository more lightweight we have removed the pre-compiled wxWidgets libraries for Visual C++ Express. They can instead be downloaded from IT's learning. You can unzip them in the VC++ directory and CMake will find them automatically. If you need to put them somewhere else for storage reasons, you need to change the path in the CMake configuration.

The reinitialize operation is used to make sure that the level set always is close to a signed distance function. 
This is done making sure that the length of the gradient always is kept close to 1. 
By always having the grid described in this way, it is certain that whenever moving in the direction of the gradient towards the surface with the distance $d$. 
The closest point on the surface will not change and the distance to the surface is now $d$ less then it was before.

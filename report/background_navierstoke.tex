\subsection{Navier-Stokes equation}
The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in equation (\ref{eq:navierstokes}) offers a way to describe the motion of fluids. 
This equation is the base of most simulations of fluids like water, smoke and fire. 
The equation is made out of a set of partial different equations that describes how the fluid should be behaving trough out the simulation.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:navierstokes}
  FIX THIS
\end{equation}
The equations has several parts that represent different physical behaviors of the fluid. 
In the equation, $\vec{u}$ represents the velocity of the fluid.

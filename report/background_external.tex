When fire is simulated as it would appear on earth, it is affected by the environment that it is in. 
The characteristics of a lit candle is caused by gravity, combined with boyancy that makes the flame rise and flicker. 
As the air around the flame increases in temperature the hot air rises, causing an upward motion to the flame.
If a fire is lit in space with no gravity acting on it, it would take the shape of a sphere.

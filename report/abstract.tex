This is a project report for the course TN1008 - Advanced Simulation and Visualization of Fluids in Computer Graphics held at Link\"oping University, 2013. In this report we present an implementation of a physically based simulation of fire. The implementation is largely based on the paper Physically Based Modeling and Animation of Fire by Nguyen et al. We simulate fire by using two sets of incompressible flow equations representing the unignited fuel and the hot gaseous products. These equations are coupled together using a ghost fluid method and the interface seperating the fuilds are tracked using a level set implicit surface. We also track the temperature across the simulation to simulate external forces such as buoyancy, and to be able to render the simulation with a visually accurate result. The simulation was rendered using raycasting which was implemted in C++, as was the rest of the project.
